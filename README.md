## Who am I?

I am a creative technologist who is passionate about the Internet of Things ( IoT ). I believe that there is nothing greater than working on something that you enjoy, which makes you create awesome things.

Till now, I have worked on different layers of IoT Stack ( Device Hardware | Device Software | Communications | Cloud Platforms | Cloud Applications ) and developed IoT solutions in the areas of Smart Home, Smart Mobility, and Smart Infrastructure. I continue to explore new topics and technologies in the exciting area of the Internet of Things. 

My other areas of interest include Software Architecture patterns, Agile methodologies, Clean Code principles, Design Thinking, User Experience Design, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain.

When I am not working, I am usually with a sheet of paper and a bunch of pencils sketching some stuff. I am a creative person who loves logo designing and graphics creation. I travel and take photographs whenever I can.

My mantra: "An engineer should know everything about something and something about everything"

## I’m currently working on

### Sudoc
Developing my personal tech blog with focus on IoT, self-designed and built using NextJS and Strapi

### Smart Infrasturcture and Smart Grids
Working on the research projects in the aforementioned area at Siemens

## What I have worked on

### Smart Mobility
Worked with Bosch Engineering to build Calponia, a cloud-based platform with the goal to simplify and automate complex development processes.
Worked on providing connectivity services for IoT devices that are using Calponia.
